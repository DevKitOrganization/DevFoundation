/// cases as well. See ``PredefinedDelaySequenceRetryPolicy`` and ``AggregateRetryPolicy`` for concrete policies that
/// are included with DevFoundation.

    ///   - previousDelay: The previous delay that was returned by the retry policy for this operation. `nil` means that
    ///     no previous attempt was made.
