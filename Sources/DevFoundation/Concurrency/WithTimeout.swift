/// Runs an async operation with a timeout.
///
/// This function creates a structured concurrency context where the provided operation races against a timeout. If the
/// operation completes before the timeout expires, its result is returned. If the timeout expires first, the operation
/// is canceled.
///
///     let result = try await withTimeout(.seconds(5)) {
///         try await someSlowOperation()
///     }
///
/// - Note: It is up to the operation to check cancellation to honor the timeout. If the operation ignores cancellation,
///   the timeout will not be effective.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - timeout: The maximum duration to wait for the operation to complete.
///   - priority: The priority of the task that runs the operation. Pass `nil` to use the current taskâ€™s priority.
///   - operation: The async operation to perform.
/// - Returns: The result of the operation.
