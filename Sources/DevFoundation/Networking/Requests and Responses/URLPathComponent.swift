/// URL path components are used by ``WebServiceRequest``s to perform some basic sanitization of URLs. Instead of
/// providing an entire path, web service requests provide path components, which are joined with a `"/"` character to
/// form a full path. Path components cannot contain `"/"` characters; they will be removed upon initialization.
///
/// `URLPathComponent`s are expressible by string literal, and thus can be created with minimal syntactic overhead.
///
///     let pathComponents: [URLPathComponent] = ["path", "to", "resource"]
